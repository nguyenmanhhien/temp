Unix

init 0 :  Shutdown (goes thru the /etc/rc0.d/* scripts then halts)
init 1  :  Single user mode or emergency mode means no network no multitasking is present in this mode only root has access in this runlevel
init 2  :  No network but multitasking support is present .
init 3  :  Network is present multitasking is present but with out GUI .
init 4  :  It is similar to runlevel 3; It is reserved for other purposes in research.
init 5  :  Network is present multitasking and GUI is present with sound etc.
init 6  :  This runlevel is defined to system restart.
init s   : Tells the init command to enter the maintenance mode. When the
system enters maintenance mode from another run level, only the system console
is used as the terminal.
init S  : Same as init s.
init m : Same as init s and init S.
init M : Same as init s or init S or init m.
We can take it from above that 4 options(S,s,M,m) are synonymous.
